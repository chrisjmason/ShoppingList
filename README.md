# ShoppingList

A simple app that enables people to keep a shopping list.

Created to practice/demonstrate the use of an MVP/semi-clean architecture and material design principles.

The base local version of my SharedShopper app. 

The MVP architecture made it very easy to convert the local data/model layer in this app into the global version used in SharedShopper.
